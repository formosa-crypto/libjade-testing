# Jasmin Dilithium

Learning formal verification by implementing [Crystals Dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/) in [Jasmin](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin).

Work in progress.

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/ethanlee515/jasmin-dilithium/wiki) for project description.

## Notes

* Currently hard-coded at level 3
* `twiddle_factors.jazz` is auto-generated using `write_twiddle_factors.cpp`.
* EasyCrypt proofs severely outdated
* I don't know how to use CMake...
